			Husky is a name for dogs that sledging in North, this name was being used to called dogs by the Eskimos in 1852. <img src="eskimo.png" alt="siberia" 
			align="right" height="200" width="280">However, the other name for them is Siberian husky, they are adaptive because they can survive in a 
			extremely cool environtment. Long time ago, they were being kept by the resident in Chukchi. Because of the chatacteristics of vigorous and strong 
			and the skills of adaptive, they usually being used to haunt animals, sledge and take care of children in the past, but people also keep it as a pet today.</p>

			Husky is my favorite dog because it is the most handsome and cute in the world, in my opnion. I have kept a husky since 2015 April. 
			She is brown and white, female, energetic and friendly, every stranger that approach her, she will not bark at them but looks excited. 
			Remembered then I didn't know why do I have valor to beg my mom to let me keep a dog, but she agreed though, and helped me search on several 
			websites. By the way, we have a deal of not to buy a husky but adapt, because there are a lot of stray dogs and it is expensive to buy one.

			a home feels like.

			One day mom told me there was a woman who is finding a person to adapt her husky, because she was being pregnant and she cannot afford 
			the expenses two dogs, so I we decided to visit the woman's house. The husky's  name is "Gabi", and she doesn't really well on her skin, 
			maybe her owner seldom take a bath with her. She also has a bad habit too, drinking toilet water was what mom saw in the woman's house, and 
			Gabi will afraid of broom, because the woman used to punish her by broom.<img src="broom.png" alt="broom" align="right" height="180" width="180"> </p>
			
			
		<p>	In April 30, 2015, the first time I saw her was on my phone, I received a picture from my mom after school, and I was really shocked that mom truly adapt her!
		 I share this joy with my friends and they all feel jealous on me. I will never forget it. 
		<img src="hospital.png" alt="hospital" align="left" height="180" width="180">When we adapte her, we took her to have a physical examination, and found 
		out her skin problems, then follow doctor's instruction to heal her. I remembered that she need to take medicine after every meal, and it is really hard to fed 
		her with only medicine. You need to mix it with food she like such as bread and Baozi, also you cannot do this process in fron tof her because she is really
		clever to pick the medicine out and eat the food....But this is just a period to recognize her and take care of her, now she is really healthy with 
		a thirty something kilograms and live well now.</p>
